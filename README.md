compile with c++23 and my cth library.

if the cth library is incompatible (any compiler errors) create an issue i'll fix it or get the right date cth urself :)

there is a win binary in the releases too

needs yt-dlp and if you want to only download music ffmpeg.

both should be in the path, altho ffmpeg can be manually specified
